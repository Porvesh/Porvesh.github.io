### Robotics
- Implemented an A-star path planning algorithm to find collision-free paths in 2D environments.
- Developed Euler and Velocity Verlet integrators, a PID controller, and a simple pendulum simulation.
- Built forward kinematics for arbitrary robots, predicting the spatial layout in a 3D world based on joint configurations.
- Designed inverse kinematics for end-effector position control using gradient descent with the Jacobian transpose.
- Created collision-free motion planning algorithms using RRT, RRT*, and RRT-Connect to navigate complex environments.

#### Control Strategies
- Implemented an iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) for inverted double-pendulum swing-up on a cart.
- Developed shooting and collocation methods for finite horizon Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) with input constraints.
- Applied MPPI for cartpole swing-up, optimizing nonlinear trajectories and achieving stable pole-up configurations.

#### Reinforcement Learning
- Designed reward functions for robotic manipulation, optimizing task success rates in obstacle-free and obstacle-present environments.
