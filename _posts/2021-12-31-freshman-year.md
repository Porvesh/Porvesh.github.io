2020 was a year like no other. COVID hit, exams got cancelled, entrance exams postponed, colleges closed—everything closed. It’s the year that transformed my life the most. Here’s a look back at the moments that defined it:

### Highlights of the Year

- **The End of School (Sort Of):**  
  My last board exam got cancelled. That was the unofficial end of school. I was an adult (or at least that's what the government says) and heading to college.

- **Part-Time at Namma Ooru Foundation:**  
  Worked part-time with [Namma Ooru Foundation](https://nammaooru.org/) where I made posters and picked up skills in Adobe tools.  
  Contributed to sustainability initiatives across the city.

- **My First Bike:**  
  Got my driving license. Borrowed my uncle’s **Royal Enfield Classic 350 Chrome Black**—a beauty I’ll never forget. Taught around 10 of my friends how to ride it and rode it every chance I got.  
  Never named her. Regret. She deserved one.

- **My First Laptop:**  
  Got a Lenovo Legion. Clocked 1000+ hours of CS:GO, made some of my closest friends, sat through Zoom classes, and picked up a few new skills.  
  *Red Dead Redemption 2* still holds the crown.

- **Beginning of my Tech Bro Era**  
  That laptop sparked my tech journey. Did the classic [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) and started [Andrew Ng’s ML course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). Typical.

- **TV Show Critic:**  
  Entered my binge era—*Game of Thrones*, *Better Call Saul*, *The Mentalist*. Part-time TV critic.

- **A Party Mid-Pandemic:**  
  Got a surprise birthday party during COVID. Didn’t expect it, but it meant the world.

- **The First "Adults" Trip:**  
  Went on a classic Chennai 18+ trip—to Pondicherry. Hit a resto-bar, drank some **virgin mojitos** like rebels.

- **Last Trip Before the Big Move:**  
  Took a trip to **Kodanad** with friends. Saw some beautiful stars and tried my hand at night photography. (See the photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/202138159@N05/albums/72177720323398324/)).

- **Hostel Life:**  
  Spent a month in SSN hostel while waiting for college decisions.  
    - Climbed the SSN clock tower (don’t tell anyone)  
    - Stayed out past curfew, studied (sometimes), and made memories  
    - Got ragged by seniors and confirmed I am, in fact, a terrible dancer  
    - Ate mess food... and liked it?

- **Decision to Study Abroad:**  
  Got into UMICH. Decided to come to America for college—**GO BLUE!** [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu)

- **Friends & Goodbyes:**  
  Made some amazing friends, lost touch with a few others. Post-school life hit hard. You don’t realize how easy it is to drift apart once school ends.  

- **Farewell:**  
  Spent all my time with friends and family before leaving for the U.S.  
  First time I saw 10 grown men cry at the airport. Grateful to have friends like that—safe to say, emotions were really **taking off**.

- **Parting with My Bike:**  
  Had to say goodbye to my Royal Enfield before leaving. My first heartbreak. (Surely the last too..)

- **Quotes That Hit Different This Year:**  
  “You will be shocked, kids, when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever.” – *Ted Mosby*  
  “Sometimes things have to fall apart to make way for better things.” – *Ted Mosby*

  Maybe because this was the show I was watching. Maybe because it just fit.

### Looking Back

2020 wasn’t just the year the world paused. It was the year I pressed play—on a new phase of life. It gave me the space to reflect, to reimagine, and to reset.

Not everything went to plan. But maybe that’s what made it special. 

Here’s to Freshman year.

Peace.
