This title is a tribute to the show *Mentalist*, and calls back to the poem *The Tyger* by William Blake.

I took this photo of a tiger on my family trip to Shimla at the Himalayan Zoo.  
While everyone else was trying to get a clear shot, mine turned out blurry—focusing on the cage, not the tiger. That made me reflect on the true meaning behind the moment.

### 🐅 *Tyger Tyger, burning bright*

Within Shimla's enchanting wintery draw,  
I embarked on a family trip, filled with awe.  
With camera in hand, eager to capture the wild,  
I ventured to the Himalayan Zoo like a child.  

Excitement surged as I explored the domain,  
Animals of beauty, their essence to frame.  
Through the lens, I clicked away, seeking fame,  
Unaware of the deeper meaning—it was all just a game.  

A crowd erupted, rushing toward a certain frame,  
A tiger, regal and fierce, from slumber came.  
Driven by the allure of social media's claim,  
I sprinted to the cage, longing for my moment of fame.  

But then, in a moment of sudden clarity,  
Amidst the chaos, a profound rarity,  
A blurry image captured my bewildered gaze—  
The fence in focus, the tiger in a hazy haze.  

In that photo, a message became clear:  
A reflection of humanity's skewed veneer.  
Fixated on surface, on external guise,  
While the essence of truth remained in disguise.  

Behind that fence, a symbol of captivity and woe,  
The tiger stood confined, unable to freely roam.  
In my quest for pleasure, I had lost my way,  
Neglecting empathy—betraying what it means to be human, I'd say.  

Money and enjoyment, our misguided guide—  
At what cost do we leave compassion aside?  
The tiger, once revered as our national pride,  
Now caged in a zoo, as we revel outside.  

This photo, now cherished, holds a special place,  
A reminder of the truths I failed to embrace.  
The fence in focus, the tiger a blurry haze,  
Reflecting society's misguided ways.  

With every step we take, let empathy guide our way,  
To honor the wild, beyond mere display.  
For the beauty of life, let's hold it dear,  
With hearts attuned to nature, forever sincere.
